The Firebase Authentication SDK may throw an unexpected error if the user's credential is invalid or if there is a network issue during the authentication process.  For example, using `signInWithEmailAndPassword` with incorrect credentials might throw an error that isn't easily handled, leading to unexpected app behavior.  Another issue could arise if the app attempts authentication while offline.  The error messages might not always be clear, making debugging challenging.
