# Firebase Authentication Error Handling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to Firebase Authentication: unexpected error messages and insufficient error handling. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows an example of how an authentication attempt might fail without clear indication of the cause, and `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a more robust solution.

## Problem:

The Firebase Authentication SDK can throw various errors, but error messages may not always be self-explanatory, especially for network issues or invalid credentials.  Simple error handling can miss crucial details, leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution:

Implement more comprehensive error handling to identify and handle various Firebase Authentication errors gracefully. The improved error handling helps provide informative messages to users and prevents application crashes.  Consider handling specific error codes to take targeted actions.
